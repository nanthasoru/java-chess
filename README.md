Chess game in Java

## it's a game

It's my very first 'big project', i neved touched JPanel and JFrame before, or made any GUI programs.

I decided to make a simple app to train and i chose chess. (i deeply regret it was way harder than i thought)
The code for the GUI is really messy, and the code for generating moves is even more chaotic.

But everything works just fine !
